Title: Test, Check, Verify, Investigate the Monotonic Properties of Numeric 
    Vectors

Description: This package provides several functions for testining, checking, 
    verify and investigating the monotonic properties of numeric vectors. 
    Function 'monotonicity' gives the monotonic properties while a family of 
    'is_*' function can be used to test if the numeric vector is (strictly) 
    increasing, decreasing, neither or constant. 
Suggests:
